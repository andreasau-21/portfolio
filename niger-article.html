            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In 2014, faced with the need to tackle a series of challenges such as jihadist terrorism, migration flows, and climate change in a multilateral way, five West African countries came together in a forum, the G5 Sahel, bringing together Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Niger. This region of West Africa is considered a global terrorism hotspot, thinking that, according to data from the Institute of Economics and Peace “Global Terrorism Index 2024,” these five countries alone account for half of the terrorism victims in 2023.</p>

            <h2>Government Instability and the Recent Coup</h2>
            <p>Another element characterizing the G5 Sahel is government instability, with one of the highest numbers of coups in the world. On July 26, 2023, Colonel Abdourahamane Tiani, head of the presidential guard, took control of Niger, overthrowing President Bazoum, marking the fifth coup in the G5 Sahel in three years. Before Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso had each been victims of two coups between 2020 and 2022.</p>

            <p>The coup in Niger has many facets and cannot be reduced purely to regional or local dynamics, nor solely to international influences. Niger had its first democratic transition of power only in April 2021, when Mahamadou Issofou handed over the reins to Mohamed Bazoum. The newly elected president was never fully appreciated by the country’s military forces; proof of this was a failed coup just a few days before his inauguration on March 31, 2021.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Natural Resources</h2>
            <p>During his brief time in power, Bazoum distinguished himself as a more liberal figure than one might expect from a conservative country with a Muslim majority (over 99% of the population). His attempt to invest in the country’s human capital, especially in the education of young women, was not fully accepted by Nigerien society.</p>

            <p>The coup leaders formed a military junta under the name of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP) and pointed to the country's declining economic situation as one of the triggering factors of the coup. However, the likelihood that the economy was a major cause is low, given that Tiani had served in the presidential guard even during the previous decade, under less capable administrations than the one he overthrew.</p>

            <p>The country's natural resources may have also been a casus belli. Three important natural resources contribute to the vast majority of Niger’s GDP: gold, but especially uranium and oil. Following the completion of an oil pipeline by the China National Petroleum Corp., which connects Niger and Benin, Niger’s GDP was projected to increase by 24%, along with a 68% rise in exports. Despite the strategic importance of uranium production, oil is becoming crucial for Niger.</p>

            <h2>International Relations and Withdrawal of Troops</h2>
            <p>Uranium remains strategically important for France and the European Union, and the African country produces 5% of the world’s uranium, making it the seventh-largest producer. In 2022, a quarter of Europe’s uranium needs were covered by Niger, a figure that fell to about 15% in 2023.</p>

            <p>France has particularly focused its energy independence on nuclear power, creating an even more significant link between the two countries. France launched Operation Barkhane in 2014 with the aim of curbing the spread of Islamic terrorism in the region, deploying military missions in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. After the coups in the first two countries, Niger became the main Western ally in the region, with over 1,500 French troops stationed there.</p>

            <p>Other forces in the country included about a thousand U.S. troops and various EU missions, including the Italian one (Operation MisiN) and the German one. French troops officially left the country in December 2023, while U.S. forces are completing their withdrawal in September 2024. Interestingly, Italy appears to be the only Western country intent on remaining in Niger, primarily due to issues related to reducing migration flows.</p>

            <h2>The Influence of Russia</h2>
            <p>The withdrawal of troops from the country is particularly significant for France. Their presence in the region is increasingly unwelcome and has been used as justification in both Mali and Burkina Faso. France was immediately accused by the coup leaders of being the mastermind behind the one-week ultimatum to reinstall Bazoum, issued by ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) and, in particular, Nigeria. The feared risk of military intervention led the CNSP to call on Nigeriens to demonstrate support for the country’s new government against foreign invasions.</p>

            <p>During the protests, alongside the flags of Niamey and the burning of French flags, Russian banners also appeared. The last major actor influencing local dynamics is Moscow, particularly through the former Wagner group.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, there is little clarity about the origins of the coup and the direction Niger’s future will take. The close relationship between Tiani and Issofou may have influenced the former to act to prevent Bazoum from redistributing control of natural resources, especially oil and uranium. The only certainty is that Niger’s brief history as an independent nation has seen five coups in just 70 years. This indicates that the division between civil and military power has never been fully absorbed by the country, which in its history has had more military leaders than civilian ones. However, Niger is only one piece of the puzzle in the Sahel and West Africa, with actors such as France, the United States, the European Union, as well as Russia, Ukraine, the military juntas in Burkina Faso and Mali, Nigeria, and ECOWAS. Niger serves as a bridge between Central-Western Africa and the Mediterranean and is a country rich in natural resources, which makes it central to the plans of many actors, making it harder to clearly tell its story.</p>
